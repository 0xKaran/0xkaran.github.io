In this tutorial, Iâ€™m going to show you how to get a free SSL certificate from Cloudflare. This will turn your website from `http` to `https` making it more secure, reliable and more trusted among your users.

## What is SSL?
SSL (Secure Sockets Layer) is a standard security used for establishing an encrypted link between a web server and a browser. This ensures that all data passed between the web server and the browser remain private and secured.

## Why use SSL?
The main reason to use SSL is to keep sensitive information sent across the internet to remain private and encrypted that only the intended recipient will be able to decode it.

Another reason is that users will completely trust your website especially if it handles sensitive pieces of information such as credit card information.

## Step 1: Login to your Cloudflare account.
Head over to the [official website of Cloudflare](https://www.cloudflare.com/) and click **Log In** in the top menu.
